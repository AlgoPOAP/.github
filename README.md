# AlgoPoaP
### **AlgoPoaP** is the Proof of Attendance Protocol built on Algorand (AVM V1.1) which aims to be elevated into a Proof Of Anything Protocol in future (with use of coming state proofs feature on Algorand).

The original idea of PoaP on blockchain is developed for Ethereum ecosystem and is Token based and lacks many features. **AlgoPoaP** elevates, extends and expands that original idea and implements it on Algorand. 

**AlgoPoaP** dApp is consisted of a frontend calling an Algorand ASC system in which ASCs use each other via C2C calls introduced in Algorand AVM V1.1
